# Project 1: **Descriptive Analysis of Delayed Tuition Payments at UCW Finance Department**

The primary goal of this project is to analyze tuition payment data to identify patterns behind delayed payments and help the Finance Department at University Canada West (UCW) enhance cash flow management. This includes evaluating student payment behaviors, understanding delay factors, and proposing improvements in payment processing and financial follow-up systems.

**1. Data Profiling**

- Used AWS Glue DataBrew to profile raw datasets stored in an S3 bucket.

- Evaluated nulls, outliers, and type mismatches.

- Found inconsistencies in Payment_Status and missing values in Payment_Method.

**2. Data Cleaning & Cataloging**

Cleaned dataset by:

- Removing null rows in critical fields.

- Standardizing Payment_Method entries (e.g., "cc" ‚Üí "Credit Card").

- Converting string date fields to datetime.

Designed and documented cleaning steps using **AWS DataBrew** jobs.

Registered cleaned dataset into **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.

**3. Descriptive Statistical Analysis**

Performed exploratory analysis using Athena + Google Collab:

- Total monthly payments and average transaction value.

- Distribution of payment methods.

- Payment completion rate by semester and location.

**4. Customer Segmentation**

In this stage, we analyzed the cleaned and joined dataset (finance-ETL-binh) to segment customers based on their payment behaviors using criteria derived from calculated fields like DaysDelayed, TotalAmount, and CreditTerms.

Segmentation Logic:

- Early Payers: Customers who paid invoices ‚â• 3 days before the due date.

- On-Time Payers: Customers whose payments matched the due date (¬± 2 days).

- Late Payers: Customers with average payment delays of more than 3 days.

- Chronic Late Payers: Customers with >50% of invoices delayed beyond 7 days.

Segment Analysis:

- Chronic Late Payers mostly had long credit terms (60‚Äì90 days).

- Early Payers often used automated digital payments.

- Late Payers were frequently international accounts with invoice delivery errors or complex billing instructions.

- This segmentation helped target the groups for deeper root cause analysis and policy revision.

**5. Insights and Findings**

Based on our Week 4 analysis and segmentation, the following insights were identified:

Payment Delays Are Systemic: Over 38% of total invoices were paid after the due date, with peak delays occurring near semester starts (January and September).

Top 3 Delay Factors:

- Long payment terms (e.g., 90-day contracts) correlated with a 68% delay rate.

- Invoice delivery issues (missing or erroneous emails) led to a spike in unpaid invoices.

- Lack of follow-up reminders resulted in delays beyond 10 days in 22% of cases.

Chronic Late Payers accounted for over 70% of the total overdue balance, showing a small group significantly affected cash flow.

Digital Payment Users Paid Faster: Those using online banking or auto-pay settled invoices 5‚Äì7 days earlier than manual payers.

**6. Recommendations**

To improve cash flow and reduce payment delays, the following actions are recommended:

Revise Credit Terms:

- Shorten standard payment terms from 90 to 45 days for high-risk customers.

- Introduce early-payment incentives and late-payment penalties.

Enhance Invoice Delivery:

- Automate invoice emailing through integration with AWS SES and scheduling services.

- Implement an audit log to track delivery and receipt confirmation.

Improve Follow-Up Processes:

- Schedule automated reminders for approaching and overdue invoices.

- Assign finance team roles in AWS to monitor specific account segments using dashboards.

Monitor Key Segments:

- Track chronic late payers via dashboards (e.g., Power BI, QuickSight).

- Engage these customers with payment restructuring or credit review.

- Leverage Machine Learning (future scope):

- Predict late payments based on customer history, behavior, and payment method.

***AWS IAM***

IAM practrice: Lab 1

**Topic:** Managing Identity and Access in AWS using IAM

**Lab Objectives:**

This lab provides hands-on experience with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to help you understand how AWS manages users, groups, and permissions securely and effectively. By completing this lab, you will:

- Explore **pre-created IAM users and groups** within the AWS environment.
- Understand how **IAM policies** (managed and inline) control access to AWS resources.
- Simulate a **real-world scenario** by assigning users to appropriate IAM groups based on job roles and required permissions.
- Locate and utilize the **IAM user sign-in URL** to test access capabilities.
- Observe how **permission boundaries affect user actions** on AWS services like EC2 and S3.

**Key Skills Practiced:**

- Navigating the **IAM Console** to inspect users, groups, policies, and permissions.
- Adding users to IAM groups with **predefined permission policies** (AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess, AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess).
- Differentiating between **Managed Policies** and **Inline Policies**.
- Logging in as IAM users to **validate access rights** and demonstrate the effect of attached policies.
- Understanding **least privilege access** by testing what users can and cannot do based on their group membership.

**Real-World Scenario Practiced:**

You configured IAM access for three fictional employees:
| User    | Group         | Permissions                                 |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| user-1  | S3-Support     | Read-only access to Amazon S3               |
| user-2  | EC2-Support    | Read-only access to Amazon EC2              |
| user-3  | EC2-Admin      | View, start, and stop EC2 instances         |

Each user's access level was verified by signing in via a unique IAM URL and attempting permitted and restricted actions within the AWS Console.

‚úÖ **Outcome:**

This lab solidified foundational knowledge of AWS IAM by demonstrating how centralized identity and access control works in practice. It reinforced the importance of **policy-based access control**, and how IAM enables secure and scalable AWS operations.

# Project 2 (Group project): **AWS Data Analytic Platform for The City of Vancouver**

The City of Vancouver processes a variety of services and operations which is a significant source of data. To enhance decision-making processes that are founded on data, as well as for the sake of the City's transparency, it is critical for the City to have a defined framework. This framework is a Data Analytic Platform (DAP) which allows the City to manage and analyze their data, helping departments to understand trends, fill gaps, and optimally allocate resources.

[BUSI653_04_Group 1_Project Phase 2.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20876643/BUSI653_04_Group.1_Project.Phase.2.pdf)

The project phase 1 and 2 have achieved the primary goal of using essential AWS services to create a functioning DAP which follows the standard 5-stage data pipeline. We demonstrated practice fully in naming, encryption and separation of storage zones. However, to go deeper into the project under Module 9 recommendations, we need to improve automation, monitoring, performance optimization and cost control strategies. If these improvements are taken, the DAP will be more robust, scalable and ready for enterprises
